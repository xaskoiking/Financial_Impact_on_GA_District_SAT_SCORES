## Project Proposal Eason, King, Nguyen, Krishnamurthy
Scope:
For this project, our team examing whether or not school districts with higher budgets have higher standardized student test score averages (ACT/SAT). We will be using  Georgia data on school districts budget funding and aggregate student performances by districts on standardized test scores for 2010-2016. 

We are excluding private and charter schools.

Hypothesis
School districts with larger budgets will have students with higher test scores

Null Hypothesis
School district budget does not affect student test scores

Sources of data:
SAT/ACT datasets
https://gosa.georgia.gov/downloadable-data
Financial dataset
https://app.doe.k12.ga.us/ows-bin/owa/fin_pack_revenue.entry_form


Data types:
county districts: string
budget: integer 
number of students: integer
SAT Combined: integer
districts: geodata

Key questions:
1) Does the amount of budget allot to districts have an impact on student's district's national test scores?
2) Is there a difference in standardized test scores by regions of the state?
3) What is the spread of the budget by districts?

Hypothesis:
The Student's success rate in SAT, does have a correlation with the amount funded for the School District
Hypoth: There is a relation between SAT scores and amount of funding per school budget
Null: There is no relation between SAT Scores and amount of funding per school budget

Hypoth: There is a relationship between FTE hours/student with SAT scores
Null: There is no relationship between FTE hours/student with SAT scores

Hypoth: There is a relationship between the number of missed days of the school year and a students SAT score
Null: There is no relationship between the number of missed days and student SAT score
